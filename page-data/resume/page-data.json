It used technologies such as OOP PHP7, AngularJS and Bootstrap 3. It helped the boarding school of BBIS (Berlin Brandenburg International School) to remove its paper-based sign-out (leaving the building), laundry slot reservation, and food ordering system. The system has been in use and has evolved since its introduction in 2014</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<h3>ADDITIONAL INFORMATION</h3>\n<p>Languages: English, Bulgarian </p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<h3>WORK EXPERIENCE</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<h4>Web Development Lab Helper | University of Surrey</h4>\n<p>I had to make sure that the first year students would be able to complete the lab tasks assigned by their lecturer. This requires a deep understanding of web programming, as I had to answer multiple questions and fix different problems in every lab.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<h4>Freelance Work | Multiple</h4>\n</li>\n<li>I made sure that the clients get exactly what they ask for</li>\n<li>I provided free of charge support if an unexpected error appeared or any questions related to the code/practices were raised</li>\n<li>Chat System for a Training Center in a Belgium Hospital</li>\n<li>Laravel based website for a Game Studio</li>\n<li>A Website for game-related services</li>\n<li>Online Calculator that predicts the traits of a baby, based on data gathered from the mother and father </li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<h3>EDUCATION &#x26; QUALIFICATIONS</h3>\n<p>University of Surrey - BSC Computer Science Year 1 Average Year 1 Grade - 82% (First-class)</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Web Publishing And Databases (89%)</li>\n<li>Mobile Computing (89%)</li>\n<li>Foundations Of Computing (85%)</li>\n<li>Foundations Of Computing II (86%)</li>\n<li>Programming Fundamentals (83%)</li>\n<li>Software Engineering (85%)</li>\n<li>Data Structures And Algorithms (75%)</li>\n<li>Computer Logic (67%)  </li>\n</ul>\n<p>My first year in university was the first time that I could apply the programming knowledge that I have been accumulating throughout the years into practice. Other than the technical skills in different programming languages, such as Java, PHP, Python, JavaScript, and others, I enjoyed learning about and applying the practices of Software Engineering. This is something I look forward to transferring at the workplace. </p>\n<p>Berlin Brandenburg International School - IB Diploma</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Economics SL (6)</li>\n<li>German B SL (5)</li>\n<li>English A L&#x26;L (5)</li>\n<li>Mathematics HL (5)</li>\n<li>Chemistry SL (5)</li>\n<li>Physics HL (4)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The subjects I chose for my IB diploma were mostly irrelevant to my university degree. This being said, I have been coding and creating small projects as a hobby all throughout middle and high school. The experience I have gathered throughout these years has helped me tremendously during the first year of my Computer Science degree.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<h3>INTERESTS</h3>\n<p>Other than my academic interests, I have been involved in sports actives in the areas of Mixed Martial Arts (MMA), May-Thai and Kickboxing. In 2018 I became the vice-president of the University of Surrey Wakeboarding Society, which organizes regular trips to lakes near the campus and social events as well. Apart from physical activities, I´m very interested in ESports (Electronic Sports) and currently compete in the NUEL (National University Esports League) with the university team.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>","frontmatter":{"title":"Resume"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":true}}}
