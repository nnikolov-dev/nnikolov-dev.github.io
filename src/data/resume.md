The system has been in use and has evolved since its introduction in 2014
* ### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION
  Languages: English, Bulgarian 
* ### WORK EXPERIENCE
  * #### Web Development Lab Helper | University of Surrey
    I had to make sure that the first year students would be able to complete the lab tasks assigned by their lecturer. This requires a deep understanding of web programming, as I had to answer multiple questions and fix different problems in every lab.
  * #### Freelance Work | Multiple
     * I made sure that the clients get exactly what they ask for
     * I provided free of charge support if an unexpected error appeared or any questions related to the code/practices were raised
     * Chat System for a Training Center in a Belgium Hospital
     * Laravel based website for a Game Studio
     * A Website for game-related services
     * Online Calculator that predicts the traits of a baby, based on data gathered from the mother and father 
* ### EDUCATION & QUALIFICATIONS
  University of Surrey - BSC Computer Science Year 1 Average Year 1 Grade - 82% (First-class)
  * Web Publishing And Databases (89%)
  * Mobile Computing (89%)
  * Foundations Of Computing (85%)
  * Foundations Of Computing II (86%)
  * Programming Fundamentals (83%)
  * Software Engineering (85%)
  * Data Structures And Algorithms (75%)
  * Computer Logic (67%)  

  My first year in university was the first time that I could apply the programming knowledge that I have been accumulating throughout the years into practice. Other than the technical skills in different programming languages, such as Java, PHP, Python, JavaScript, and others, I enjoyed learning about and applying the practices of Software Engineering. This is something I look forward to transferring at the workplace. 

  Berlin Brandenburg International School - IB Diploma
  * Economics SL (6)
  * German B SL (5)
  * English A L&L (5)
  * Mathematics HL (5)
  * Chemistry SL (5)
  * Physics HL (4)

  The subjects I chose for my IB diploma were mostly irrelevant to my university degree. This being said, I have been coding and creating small projects as a hobby all throughout middle and high school. The experience I have gathered throughout these years has helped me tremendously during the first year of my Computer Science degree.

* ### INTERESTS
  Other than my academic interests, I have been involved in sports actives in the areas of Mixed Martial Arts (MMA), May-Thai and Kickboxing. In 2018 I became the vice-president of the University of Surrey Wakeboarding Society, which organizes regular trips to lakes near the campus and social events as well. Apart from physical activities, I´m very interested in ESports (Electronic Sports) and currently compete in the NUEL (National University Esports League) with the university team.
